  <val>PLCO datasets (Phase III):
  The Phase III study was coordinated by the PLCO.  Sample collection, processing, shipping and storage were standardized 
  across all screening sites.  Briefly, blood was drawn and processed within 2 hours into vials (~1.8ml) of serum/plasma, 
  buffy coat and red blood cells. A unique specimen identification number was generated for each vial and daughter vial created.  
  Vials were stored at -70 °C and shipped to the central biorepository overnight on dry ice for long-term storage at -70°C or -157 °C. 
  
  By June of 2006, 118 cases of invasive ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers with available samples had been confirmed. 
  Tumors of “borderline malignancy” were excluded.    Serum samples most proximate to diagnosis were selected.  Controls were selected from 
  a pool of healthy individuals who remained cancer free and were matched to cases by five year age categories at blood draw, calendar year 
  of blood draw.  Women who reported a history of cancer or oophorectomy at baseline were excluded from control selection. For each case, 
  8 healthy controls were selected: 4 randomly selected from a pool of all eligible controls and representing general population controls; 
  2 with positive family history of breast or ovarian cancer; and 2 with history of an elevated CA125.  Sixty replicate pairs were randomly 
  inserted into the batches for blinded QC; ten pairs of which had CA125 values greater than 25 U/ml.  
  
  PLCO serum samples to be allocated are at the PLCO biorepository in Frederick, Md. One vial containing 1.8ml of serum was pulled from the PLCO 
  biorepository for each selected subject and was sent to the PLCO central processing lab for aliquoting. Aliquots of desired amounts for each 
  investigator teams were made side by side in small batches to avoid repeated freeze-thaw, and to minimize variability in handling.  FHCRC 
  received 0.3 ml, MDACC 0.1 ml, Partners two 0.6ml aliquots, and Pittsburgh 0.2 ml, and YUSM 0.2 ml.  Aliquots were labeled with a unique sample 
  ID, and were randomly ordered such that cases and controls were evenly distributed, then packed into 81-cell freezer boxes and kept frozen. Prior 
  to shipping, the laboratories were notified of the shipment 24 hours in advance. Aliquots were shipped overnight on dry ice.  A shipping manifest 
  containing aliquot IDs was included in the package and was also emailed to the laboratories.  Each laboratory received aliquots of identical sets 
  of samples. 
  
  Laboratory Assays
  
  Laboratory assays for the phase III PLCO study were conducted at the four separate laboratories by individuals who were blind to case or control 
  status for both the phase II and phase III specimens.  Assays included single- or multi-plex Luminex bead assays, plate-based ELISA assays, platform-based 
  (Roche E170) assays, and a mass spectroscopy-based system using surface enhanced antibody chips.  With the exceptions noted below, the assays used for the 
  phase III specimens were also used for the phase II specimens.
  
  At FHCRC single-plex Luminex bead assays were used for all markers, details of which can be found in (Shah CA, Lowe KA, Paley P, Wallace E, Anderson GL, McIntosh 
  MW, Andersen MR, Scholler N, Bergan LA, Thorpe JD, Urban N, and Drescher CW, Influence of ovarian cancer risk status on the diagnostic performance of the serum 
  biomarkers mesothelin, HE4, and CA125. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, 2009. 18(5): p. 1365-72.).   The same assays were carried over into phase III except that 
  a plate based assay for MMP-7 was introduced.  MDACC used a mass spectroscopy based system for its markers in both phases  further described in (Zhang Z, Bast RC, 
  Jr., Yu Y, Li J, Sokoll LJ, Rai AJ, Rosenzweig JM, Cameron B, Wang YY, Meng XY, Berchuck A, Van Haaften-Day C, Hacker NF, de Bruijn HW, van der Zee AG, Jacobs IJ, Fung 
  ET, and Chan DW, Three biomarkers identified from serum proteomic analysis for the detection of early stage ovarian cancer. Cancer Res, 2004. 64(16): p. 5882-90.). 
  Partners used plate-based assay for B7-H4(Diadexus), DcR3(Diadexus), CA72.4, IGF 2, Mesothelin, HE4, and Kallikrein 6 (as described in (Diamandis EP, Scorilas A, Fracchioli S, 
  Van Gramberen M, De Bruijn H, Henrik A, Soosaipillai A, Grass L, Yousef GM, Stenman UH, Massobrio M, Van Der Zee AG, Vergote I, and Katsaros D, Human kallikrein 6 (hK6): 
  a new potential serum biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of ovarian carcinoma. J Clin Oncol, 2003. 21(6): p. 1035-43)).  Platform-based assays (Roche) were used for CA125, 
  CA15.3, CA19.9, and CEA.  Unless the volume was insufficient assays were run in duplicate and averaged.  Seven markers were carried over to phase III and these included 
  B7H4, CA125, CA15.3, CA19.9, CA72.4, HE4, and HK 6.   The same assays were used except that a platform-based assay was available for CA72.4.   The two 0.3 aliquots were 
  first combined and homogenized.  UPCI used a multi-plex bead assay system was used to evaluate 34 markers in phase II.  This technique is described in (Nolen B, Marrangoni 
  A, Velikokhatnaya L, Prosser D, Winans M, Gorelik E, and Lokshin A, A serum based analysis of ovarian epithelial tumorigenesis. Gynecol Oncol, 2009. 112(1): p. 47-54).  For 
  phase III, the number of markers was reduced to 8 but the same technique was used.  For the phase II markers included in the Yale panel, these markers were evaluated using a 
  multi-plex bead system described in (Visintin I, Feng Z, Longton G, Ward DC, Alvero AB, Lai Y, Tenthorey J, Leiser A, Flores-Saaib R, Yu H, Azori M, Rutherford T, Schwartz PE, 
  and Mor G, Diagnostic markers for early detection of ovarian cancer. Clin Cancer Res, 2008. 14(4): p. 1065-72).  For the phase III specimens the same markers were carried over 
  but the analyses were performed by Laboratory Corporation of America.
