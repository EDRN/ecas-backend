  <val>One hundred ninety-five Barrett's Esophagus (BE) biopsies (145 nonprogressors and 50 progressors) were obtained from five participating centers: 
  the Mayo Clinic at Rochester/Jacksonville, the University of Arizona, the University of North Carolina, and Johns Hopkins University. 
  Bisulfite treatment was performed and promoter methylation levels of 8 genes (p16, HPP1, RUNX3, CDH13, TAC1, NELL1, AKAP12 and SST) were determined by 
  qMSP on an ABI 7900 Sequence Detection (Taqman) System. ÃŸ- actin was used for normalization. A standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of CpGenome 
  Universal Methylated DNA (CHEMICON, Temecula, CA). A normalized methylation value (NMV) for each gene of interest was defined as described.(11) Wetlab analysts (ZJ 
  and YC) and all SJM laboratory personnel were blinded to specimen progressor or nonprogressor status.
