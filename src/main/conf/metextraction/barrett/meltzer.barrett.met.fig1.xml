  <val>One hundred ninety-five Barrett’s Esophagus (BE) biopsies (145 nonprogressors and 50 progressors) were obtained from 
  five participating centers: the Mayo Clinic at Rochester/Jacksonville, the University of Arizona, the University of North 
  Carolina, and Johns Hopkins University. 
  
  Bisulfite treatment was performed and promoter methylation levels of 8 genes (p16, HPP1, RUNX3, CDH13, TAC1, NELL1, AKAP12 and 
  SST) were determined by qMSP on an ABI 7900 Sequence Detection (Taqman) System. ß- actin was used for normalization. A standard curve 
  was generated using serial dilutions of CpGenome Universal Methylated DNA (CHEMICON, Temecula, CA). A normalized methylation value (NMV) 
  for each gene of interest was defined as described.(11) Wetlab analysts (ZJ and YC) and all SJM laboratory personnel were blinded to 
  specimen progressor or nonprogressor status.

  <val>Associations between progression status and patient characteristics were tested using Student’s t-test or Chi-squared testing. Relationships 
  between biomarkers and patient progression status were examined using Wilcoxon rank-sum testing. 
  
  To evaluate the predictive utility of the markers, we constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. ROC curve analyses were first 
  conducted on individual markers, then in combination to determine whether a panel performed better than any single marker. Our algorithm rendered a 
  single composite score, using the linear predictor from a binary regression model justified under the linearity assumption. The predictive accuracy of 
  composite scores was evaluated based on a resampling algorithm: we randomly split data into a learning set containing 2/3 and a test set including 1/3 
  of observations. The combination rule derived from the learning set produced two ROC curves, from the learning and test sets, respectively. Vertical 
  differences between these two ROC curves yielded the overestimation of sensitivities at given specificities. This procedure was repeated 200 times, and 
  these 200 differences were averaged to estimate the expected overfitting. 
  
  We also utilized predictiveness curves to display risk distribution as a function of the combined marker in the population. This curve represents a plot of 
  risk associated with the vth quantile of the marker, P{D=1|Y =F-1(v)} vs. v, with F(.) the cumulative distribution of the marker. These plots display population 
  proportions at different risk levels more clearly than do other metrics (like ROC curves). Since a case-control sample was studied, we used an external progression 
  prevalence rate to calculate risk in the targeted screening population. To calibrate for future samples, a shrinkage coefficient estimated from the logistic 
  regression model was applied to the linear predictors from which risk was calculated. 
  
  All analyses were performed in R (http://www.r-project.org). Statistical data analysts (Y.Z., W.G., and Z.F.) were blinded to the identities of the 8 biomarkers.
