  <val>Risk stratification of BE patients by predictiveness curves of 8-marker panel, age alone, and 8-marker-plus-age 
  panel in combined, 2-year and 4-year prediction models. A, Predictiveness curve of 8-marker panel in combined model. After 
  rigorous overfitting correction, at risk = 0.1 and = 0.5, 45 percent and 4 percent of subjects had estimated risks below 0.1 (LR group) and
  above 0.5 (HR group), respectively; while remaining 51 percent had estimated risks between 0.1 and 0.5 (IR group). B, Predictiveness 
  curves of age alone and of 8-marker-plus-age panel in combined model. After rigorous overfitting correction, BE patients were 
  stratified into LR (15 percent) and IR (85 percent) groups by age alone. BE patients were stratified into LR (51 percent), IR (44 percent) and HR (5 percent) groups 
  by 8-marker-plus-age panel. C, Predictiveness curve of 8-marker panel in 2-year model. After rigorous overfitting correction, 
  BE patients were stratified into LR (45 percent), IR (51 percent) and HR (4 percent) groups. D, Predictiveness curves of age alone and of 8-marker-plus-age panel 
  in 2-year model. After rigorous overfitting correction, BE patients were stratified into LR (11 percent) and IR (89 percent) groups by age alone. 
  BE patients were stratified into LR (52 percent), IR (44 percent) and HR (4 percent) groups by the 8-marker-plus-age panel. E, Predictiveness curve of 
  the 8-marker panel alone in the 4-year model. After rigorous overfitting correction, BE patients were stratified into LR (44 percent), 
  IR (51 percent) and HR (5 percent) groups. F, Predictiveness curves of age alone and of the 8-marker-plus-age panel in the 4-year model. After 
  rigorous overfitting correction, BE patients were stratified into LR (15 percent) and IR (85 percent) groups by age alone. BE patients were 
  stratified into LR (51 percent), IR (44 percent) and HR (5 percent) groups by 8-marker-plus-age panel. LR: low-risk; IR, intermediate-risk; HR: high-risk; 
  OC: overfitting correction.

  <val>One hundred ninety-five Barrett’s Esophagus (BE) biopsies (145 nonprogressors and 50 progressors) 
  were obtained from five participating centers: the Mayo Clinic at Rochester/Jacksonville, the University 
  of Arizona, the University of North Carolina, and Johns Hopkins University. 
  Bisulfite treatment was performed and promoter methylation levels of 8 genes (p16, HPP1, RUNX3, CDH13, TAC1, 
  NELL1, AKAP12 and SST) were determined by qMSP on an ABI 7900 Sequence Detection (Taqman) System. beta-actin 
  was used for normalization. A standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of CpGenome Universal Methylated 
  DNA (CHEMICON, Temecula, CA). A normalized methylation value (NMV) for each gene of interest was defined as described.
  (11) Wetlab analysts (ZJ and YC) and all SJM laboratory personnel were blinded to specimen progressor or nonprogressor 
  status.

  <val>Associations between progression status and patient characteristics were tested using Student’s t-test or Chi-squared testing. 
  Relationships between biomarkers and patient progression status were examined using Wilcoxon rank-sum testing. 
  To evaluate the predictive utility of the markers, we constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. ROC curve analyses 
  were first conducted on individual markers, then in combination to determine whether a panel performed better than any single marker. 
  Our algorithm rendered a single composite score, using the linear predictor from a binary regression model justified under the linearity 
  assumption. The predictive accuracy of composite scores was evaluated based on a resampling algorithm: we randomly split data into a 
  learning set containing 2/3 and a test set including 1/3 of observations. The combination rule derived from the learning set produced two 
  ROC curves, from the learning and test sets, respectively. Vertical differences between these two ROC curves yielded the overestimation of 
  sensitivities at given specificities. This procedure was repeated 200 times, and these 200 differences were averaged to estimate the expected 
  overfitting. 
  
  We also utilized predictiveness curves to display risk distribution as a function of the combined marker in the population. This curve represents 
  a plot of risk associated with the vth quantile of the marker, P{D=1|Y =F-1(v)} vs. v, with F(·) the cumulative distribution of the marker. These 
  plots display population proportions at different risk levels more clearly than do other metrics (like ROC curves). Since a case-control sample was 
  studied, we used an external progression prevalence rate to calculate risk in the targeted screening population. To calibrate for future samples, a 
  shrinkage coefficient estimated from the logistic regression model was applied to the linear predictors from which risk was calculated. 
  All analyses were performed in R (http://www.r-project.org). Statistical data analysts (Y.Z., W.G., and Z.F.) were blinded to the identities of the 8 biomarkers.
