  <val>This dataset contains records for all subjects, but only those in the training half are unblinded.  The remaining half in the 
  testing set are missing case status.  The marker values have been standardized (Each marker was first log transformed to yield a normal 
  distribution in the controls and then each was centered and scaled so that the controls had a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1).
  This dataset was distributed to the group by Mark Thornquist.
