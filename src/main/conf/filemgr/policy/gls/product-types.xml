      <key>MethodDetails</key>
      <val>Cell lines: 

Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab  were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.)

Tumors:

Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples.

DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation:

Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA  using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems).

Mutation analysis:
	
Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 microL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation.

Copy number analysis

Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were  performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler.  The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c  alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA.

Microarray analysis

RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.

      <key>MethodDetails</key>
      <val>Cell lines: 

Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab  were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.)

Tumors:

Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples.

DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation:

Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA  using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems).

Mutation analysis:
	
Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 microL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation.

Copy number analysis

Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were  performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler.  The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c  alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA.

Microarray analysis

RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.

      <key>MethodDetails</key>
      <val>Cell lines: 

Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab  were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.)

Tumors:

Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples.

DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation:

Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA  using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems).

Mutation analysis:
	
Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 microL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation.

Copy number analysis

Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were  performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler.  The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c  alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA.

Microarray analysis

RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.

  <description>Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer death worldwide, with up to 25% of cases arising in never smokers.  Lung cancers in smokers and never smokers have been shown to exhibit specific genetic and clinical features which suggests they are distinct diseases.  Despite these findings, there is still much to learn about lung tumorigenesis in these two groups.  We hypothesized that if smoker and never smoker lung tumors are different diseases, they are likely driven by different molecular mechanisms and therefore likely exhibit different patterns of copy number alterations throughout the genome.  We used Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays to generate high resolution copy number profiles for lung adenocarcinomas from 30 smokers and 30 never smokers as well as cell lines derived from 20 smokers and 20 light or never smokers to elucidate global differences in genomic aberrations between these two groups.</description>

      <val>41 cell lines
Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software. Partek normalization includes background subtraction, probe length adjustment, fragment length adjustment, and GC content adjustment.  Analysis was performed following the &quot;Copy Number&quot; workflow using SNP array data for 72 normal HapMap individuals to create a baseline for copy number.  A matrix of normalized log2 intensity ratios (tumor cell line:HapMap baseline) for each probe in each sample was generated (level 2 data).  Genomic segmentation was performed in Partek to generate a list of segmental copy number alterations in each sample using a 50 marker minimum and a p-value threshold of 10-6 to define copy number altered regions. Segmentation data was parsed into a gene-centric matrix with estimated copy number values for each gene (level 3 data).  A copy number = 2 is copy neutral; copy number &lt; 2 is a loss and copy number &gt; 2 is a copy gain. Genes were mapped using base pair coordinates from a table of RefSeq annotated genes downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (March 2006 genome build). Gene accessions with ambiguous mapping were removed from the RefSeq table. For genes with multiple accessions, the accession with the longest transcript was used for mapping.

Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software. Partek normalization includes background subtraction, probe length adjustment, fragment length adjustment, and GC content adjustment.  Analysis was performed following the &quot;Copy Number&quot; workflow using SNP array data for 72 normal HapMap individuals to create a baseline for copy number.  A matrix of normalized log2 intensity ratios (tumor cell line:HapMap baseline) for each probe in each sample was generated (level 2 data).  Genomic segmentation was performed in Partek to generate a list of segmental copy number alterations in each sample using a 50 marker minimum and a p-value threshold of 10-6 to define copy number altered regions. Segmentation data was parsed into a gene-centric matrix with estimated copy number values for each gene (level 3 data).  A copy number = 2 is copy neutral; copy number &lt; 2 is a loss and copy number &gt; 2 is a copy gain. Genes were mapped using base pair coordinates from a table of RefSeq annotated genes downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (March 2006 genome build). Gene accessions with ambiguous mapping were removed from the RefSeq table. For genes with multiple accessions, the accession with the longest transcript was used for mapping.

      <val>Cell lines: 

Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab  were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.)

Tumors:

Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples.

DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation:

Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA  using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems).

Mutation analysis:
	
Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 uL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation.

Copy number analysis

Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were  performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler.  The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c  alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA.

Microarray analysis

RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.</val>

      <val>No significant difference in miRNA expression between cell lines from non-smokers vs. smokers was observed with the sample sizes used. 
	Several miRNAs were differentially expressed between EGFR mutant (n=10) and EGFR wild-type (n=30) cell lines:
- miR-205/miR-141/miR-200c are over-expressed in EGFR mutant cell lines
A key function of these miRNAs is to maintain the epithelial cell state by suppressing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
Expression of these miRNAs was correlated with epithelial markers such as EPCAM and Claudin 7 in gene expression profiling data
It is consistent with prior reports that lung cancer arising in non-smokers have higher expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin

      <val>Two pools of samples were used in each experiment - one consisted of a pool of plasma from controls as a reference point, the other a pool of plasma from subjects with lung cancer. Each pooled sample was immunodepleted of the top six most abundant proteins (Albumin, IgG, IgA, Transferrin, Haptoglobin, and R-1-Antitrypsin) prior to further analysis. The two pools were isotopic labeling (cysteine) and mixed before separating by anion-exchange chromatography. A total of 8 pools were collected and further separated by reverse phase chromatography. A total of 96 fractions were collected for each experiment.

Each fraction is trypsinated and analyzed by a LTQ-FT mass spectrometer coupled to a nano-flow chromatography system. Tandem MS analysis was triggered on the 5 most abundant +2 or +3 ions of each MS1 with a dynamic exclusion list.

Acquired data were processed by the Computational Proteomics Analysis System pipeline. This pipeline implements the X!Tandem search algorithm with comet score module plug-in against IPI human v3.13 sequence database. Identified peptides were further validated through PeptideProphet and inferred into proteins via ProteinProphet. A merged database search was also performed on all the spectra collected from 96 fractions of each experiment.
 
The relative quantification for each pair of peptides that contains cysteine residues was computed by Q3ProteinRatioParser. Only peptides with a minimum PeptideProphet score of 0.75, and mass deviation &lt;20 ppm were considered for quantification. Ratios on a logarithmic scale of all quantified peptides were plotted on a histogram and the median of the distribution was centered at zero. All normalized peptide ratios for a specific protein were averaged to compute an overall protein ratio. Statistical significance of the protein quantitative information was obtained via two procedures: for proteins with multiple peptides quantified, a P-value for the mean log-ratio, which has mean zero under the null hypothesis, was calculated using one-sample t-test; and for proteins with a single quantitative event, the probability for the ratio was extrapolated from the distribution of ratios in a baseline-baseline experiment whereby the same sample was split in half and labeled differentially.</val>

      <val>Cell culture
The lung cancer cells are grown in lysine free media supplemented with 13C6 lysine for 7 passage to insure &gt;90 percent incorporation of isotopic labeled amino acid. 

Secreted or Shed protein
Media was changed to media with 0.1percent dialyzed FBS and incubated for 48 hours prior to collecting the conditioned media. Cells and debris are removed from media by centrifugation at 5000xg and filtration through a 0.22um filter. The conditioned media is then concentrated with Amicon 3K centrifugal filters. 

Cell surface and membrane proteins
Cell surface proteins from 2.0x108 cells will be biotinylated with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, solubilized in solution containing Igepal CA-630 with cell disruption by sonication followed by centrifugation at 20000xg. Biotinylated proteins are chromatographically isolated by affinity chromatography using 1ml of Ultralink Immobilized NeutrAvidin. Proteins bound to the column are recovered by reduction of the biotinylation reagent with 5ml of a solution containing 65umol of DTT and 1percent octyl-glucoside.

Total cell extracts
Total cell extracts are obtained by sonication of 2.0x107cells in 1ml of PBS containing 1percent octyl-glucoside and protease inhibitors followed by sonication and centrifugation at 20000xg.  

Conditioned media, cell surface proteins and total cell extract were fractionated by reverse-phase chromatography after reduction and alkylation with iodoacetamide. Each one of the reverse-phase fractions were individually digested in-solution digestion with trypsin and grouped into 24 pools according to chromatographic features. Pools are individually analyzed by LC-MS/MS in a LTQ-ORBITRAP mass spectrometer.

The acquired mass spectrometric data is analyzed by the Computational Proteomics Analysis System (CPAS) analysis pipeline which provides peptide and protein identification. The spectral counting method is used to estimate protein enrichment for each compartment</val>
