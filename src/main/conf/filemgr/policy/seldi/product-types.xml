		<description>Processed SELDI bioprocessor output from EVMS 
		(Eastern Virginia Medical School), EDRN Site 92. Comma delimited file (csv) generated using Cipehergen's 
		&quot;Peaks&quot; software. The baseline was smoothed using a window of 50 points and then subtracted 
		from each spectrum. The automatic peak detection mode was used in the Peaks software with the 
		following settings: minimum valley depth was set at 10 times the noise and the high sensitivity 
		of minimum valley depth was set at 0.5 times the noise. To eliminate those peaks were very close to the 
		baseline, the low sensitivity and high sensitivity of the peak height was set at 10 and 2 times the noise,
		respectively. The automatic peak detection slider was set at 8 for the mass region from 2 to 4 KDa, 11 
		for the mass region from 4 to 8 KDa, and 8 for the mass range from 8 to 40 KDa. Detected peaks and their 
		intensity values were then exported into excel spreadsheets.
