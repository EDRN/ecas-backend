		<description>These data come from a dilution experiment aimed at
			elucidating which features in MALDI-TOF
			mass spectrometry data are informative for quantifying peptide content.
			The details of the experiment are
			described in [1]. The primary dataset consists of 250 spectra collected from 5
			different serum sources (5
			people from a health study), each subject to 10 different concentrations of
			a peptide mixture that contained
			several known peptides. Each of the 50 prepared samples were spotted,
			randomly, 5 times each on a single plate
			producing a total of 5x10x5 = 250 spectra. An additional 30 spectra arise
			from: 2 replicate spectra from each
			of the 10 concentrations of the peptide mixture, plus 2 replicates of
			serum-only spectra from each of the 5
			serum samples.

			NOTE: An error was made during the process of randomly spotting samples to
			the plate: one of the replicates from
			concentration 6 was spotted on top of a serum-only sample. The result is that two
			spectra from this design are
			missing: serum 1, concentration 6, replicate 4 (column number 36 in
			Spectra.txt), and serum 4, concentration 0, replicate 2.
			This left one empty spot on the plate (column number 280 in Spectra.txt)
			to which we spotted a sample containing only cytochrome
			c. The latter was not used in any subsequent analysis in [1], and no
			adjustment was made for former in the analysis in
			[1] (column &#35;36 was used as is).

			<key>StudyObjective</key>
			<val>This work addresses the problem of extracting signal content
				from protein mass spectrometry data.
				A multiscale decomposition of these spectra is used to focus on local
				scale-based structure by defining
				scale-specific features. Quantification of features is accompanied by an efficient
				method for calculating
				the location of features which avoids estimation of signal-to-noise
				ratios or bandwidths.</val>

			<key>PlannedSampleSize</key>
			<val>The EDRN-Prostate-SELDI Investigational Collaboration (EPSIC)
				will implement a process to
				synchronize SELDI output at the seven participating institutions using a single
				source of pooled
				normal sera (QC). The target was to recruit 100 healthy males and 100
				healthy females to donate
				two tubes of blood. Pregnant women and subjects less than 110 pounds
				were excluded from the blood
				collection. An IRB protocol was submitted two months in advance of the project.
				After IRB approval,
				fliers were generated and posted at many locations (e.g., EVMS, hospitals,
				doctor's offices). The
				blood was collected on November 6, 2002 from 7:30 am to 2:00 pm. A total
				of 360 healthy people (154
				male and 206 female) donated two tubes of blood each to make quality
				control (QC) serum.</val>
