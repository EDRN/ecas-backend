   <description>We processed individual and pooled samples through two mass spectrometry profiling platforms, 
   Ciphergen Protein Chip reader PBScII, and Bruker Ultraflex TOF-TOF. Three analytical protocols were used, 
   HMW with SPA matrix, LMW with CHCA matrix and LMW with SPA matrix. Each sample was run in duplicate. We used 
   the sample name followed by '1' or '2' to label the duplicate spectra. Spectra generated using the same instrument 
   settings and analytical protocols were preprocessed together. All data generated from the Ciphergen Protein 
   Chip reader were preprocessed using Ciphergen Express and Protein Chip software. All MALDI TOF-TOF spectra were 
   preprocessed using Bruker ClinproTools software. All spectra were preprocessed using the following sequential 
   steps: baseline correction, recalibration/rescaling, smoothing, profile alignment and peak detection. The 
   preprocessing output is a matrix which contains identified peaks (m/z) and corresponding peak intensities. 
   All output files are .CSV format with peak position (m/z) as column header, sample number as raw header, and 
   peak intensity as value.
   
   Fuzzy controls were employed while analyzing samples on the Bruker Ultraflex TOF-TOF. For LMW with CHCA matrix, 
   null spectra were generated if no peaks with signal-to-noise ratio greater than 4 were detected within the 
   mass-to-charge range of 1500 to 8000 Da after 40 subsequently failed judgments (failed to meet signal-to-noise 
   ratio criteria). For LMW with SPA matrix, and HMW with SPA matrix, null spectra were generated if no peaks with 
   signal-to-noise ratio greater than 5 were detected within the mass-to-charge range of 2000 to 10000 Da after 30 
   subsequently failed judgments.

   <description>Pooled samples through two mass spectrometry profiling platforms, 
   Ciphergen Protein Chip reader PBScII, and Bruker Ultraflex TOF-TOF. Three analytical protocols were used, 
   HMW with SPA matrix, LMW with CHCA matrix and LMW with SPA matrix. Each sample was run in duplicate. We used 
   the sample name followed by '1' or '2' to label the duplicate spectra. Spectra generated using the same instrument 
   settings and analytical protocols were preprocessed together. All data generated from the Ciphergen Protein 
   Chip reader were preprocessed using Ciphergen Express and Protein Chip software. All MALDI TOF-TOF spectra were 
   preprocessed using Bruker ClinproTools software. All spectra were preprocessed using the following sequential 
   steps: baseline correction, recalibration/rescaling, smoothing, profile alignment and peak detection. The 
   preprocessing output is a matrix which contains identified peaks (m/z) and corresponding peak intensities. 
   All output files are .CSV format with peak position (m/z) as column header, sample number as raw header, and 
   peak intensity as value.
   
   Fuzzy controls were employed while analyzing samples on the Bruker Ultraflex TOF-TOF. For LMW with CHCA matrix, 
   null spectra were generated if no peaks with signal-to-noise ratio greater than 4 were detected within the 
   mass-to-charge range of 1500 to 8000 Da after 40 subsequently failed judgments (failed to meet signal-to-noise 
   ratio criteria). For LMW with SPA matrix, and HMW with SPA matrix, null spectra were generated if no peaks with 
   signal-to-noise ratio greater than 5 were detected within the mass-to-charge range of 2000 to 10000 Da after 30 
   subsequently failed judgments.
